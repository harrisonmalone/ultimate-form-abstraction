# Ultimate Form Abstraction

This repo implements the ultimate form abstraction [outlined in this article](https://www.brendonovich.dev/blog/the-ultimate-form-abstraction).

There's some good examples in here that would be useful for work as we use `react-hook-form`.

The site has been deployed to [Vercel](https://ultimate-form-abstraction.vercel.app/).
